You are **not** required to finish the entire worksheet provided that you were actively engaged during the entire class period. As long as you've collaborated, put in good effort and made **reasonable progress** during the lab period, you can expect to get full credit. So even if you decide to finish it at home, please submit what you have by the end of 50 minutes to make sure you get credit! "
